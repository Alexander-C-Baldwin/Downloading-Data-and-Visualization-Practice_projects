# Downloading Data and Visualization Practice Projects
In these projects I've downloaded data sets from online sources and created working visualizations of the data.
I accessed and visualized data stored in two common data formats, CSV and JSON.

## Alaska and Death Valley weather data visualizations
For this project I've used python to process weather data stored in CSV format from Sitka, Alaska and Death Valley, California.
I then used Matplotlib to generate charts based on the downloaded data to display variations in temperature over time.
