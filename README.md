# Downloading Data and Visualization Practice Projects
In these projects I've downloaded data sets from online sources and created working visualizations of the data.
I accessed and visualized data stored in two common data formats, CSV and JSON.

## Alaska and Death Valley weather data visualizations
For this project I've used python to process weather data stored in CSV format from Sitka, Alaska and Death Valley, California.
I then used Matplotlib to generate charts based on the downloaded data to display variations in temperature over time.

## Mapping Earthquakes through the world
For this project I downloaded a JSON dataset of earthquakes that occured in the world in one month.
I used Python and Plotly to make and interactive map showing the location of these earthquakes and how significant each one was.
